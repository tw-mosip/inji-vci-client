# INJI VCI Client

The **Inji VCI Client** is a library built to simplify credential issuance via [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html) protocol.  
It supports **Issuer Initiated (Credential Offer)** and **Wallet Initiated (Trusted Issuer)** flows, with secure proof handling, PKCE support, and custom error handling.
